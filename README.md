# BuildingAPI
Created a RESTFUl API

Using the framework Spring I coded an N tier design patter. Coding an API layer, service layer, and Database access layer which connects to PostgreSQL. Using Java I implemented GET, POST, PULL, and DELETE allowing users to interacte with the API. I also tested the API with the tool Postman.
